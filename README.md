# TilesetGenerator
This is a small program that takes in a sample image containing unique features of a tileset and then outputs a tileset which features all the possible permutations needed to have seamless tiling. It uses the SFML graphics module to load and do some processing on the images. The values of the image sizes and how many images are processed is hardcoded because I made this program while working on my [Tilemap Rendering Project](https://github.com/Andidy/carnegie).

Here is an example of an input image. (It has been magnified to see the image clearly.)

And the program will produce an output image like the following.
